This project (StockMart) was kickstarted with combining Create React App with a express/node.js backend. It uses PostgreSQL for its database and Materialize CSS for styling.

The application allows users to create accounts and buy stocks. The stock prices are fed from the iex cloud api and users are allocated \$5000 upon signing up for purchasing stocks.

Use "npm run dev" to start the web app and the back-end server.
